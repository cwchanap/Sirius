## Important Note for All Prompts

**CRITICAL**: For any prompts in this document that don't explicitly mention "transparent background (PNG with alpha channel)", please add this requirement to the end of each AI prompt before using it. All sprites, characters, enemies, terrain tiles, UI elements, and effects should have transparent backgrounds to ensure proper integration in the game engine.
